Project Description:

Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
This is called data wrangling, plus a showcase through analyses and visualizations, then documenting my wrangling efforts in wrangle_report.pdf, and analysis and visualization efforts in act_report.pdf .
The dataset that I wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs, Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
