Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
This is called data wrangling, plus a showcase through analyses and visualizations, then documenting my wrangling efforts in wrangle_report.pdf, and analysis and visualization efforts in act_report.pdf
